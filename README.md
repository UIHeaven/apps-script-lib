# apps-script-uber-kit
Complex modular development kit and build tool for Google ® Apps Script ™
projects


##Modules

##Features
- Automatic concatenation in proper order into a single file
- recognizes app project structure with configuration folder, see below
- Builds modular library and external dependencies (vendor-src) for particular app according to 'config.js'
- places build into corresponding app folder /build subfolder
- Build is supported on Unix environment only at the moment

## Important notes

- Library and App modules are prefixed with x.x. 
    - this numbers are used for ordering of files in bundles
    - and also for optional inclusion of modules in app's config.js

- *._.* in the file name means gulp should NOT wrap this module with (function(){})();

###App structure

```
/app-root-folder
--- /config.js
---  /app
--- --- /1.0.some.file.js
--- --- /1.1.another.file.js
--- /build       --- this will be generated by the script, add it to .gitignore
--- --- /app.js  --- the concatenated script
```

###config.js structure

```javascript
module.exports = {
    modules: {
        external: ['*'],

        app: ['*']
    }
